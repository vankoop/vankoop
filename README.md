## 👩‍💻 About Me 

Currently working in Pathology and hoping to move into a **Cyber Security Analyst** / **Data Analyst** role.
I enjoy working with data, revealing hidden patterns and being able to present insights in clear visual formats and storytelling. 


Previous study in Natural Sciences(Chemistry), a blend of both chemistry and biology modules. 
Currently studying for my BSc(Hons) Cyber Security with The Open University whilst building a strong foundation in: 
- **Python** (pands, NumPy, matplotlib)
- **SQL**
- **Data Cleaning & Wrangling**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Version Control** (Git & GitHub)
- **Jupyter Notebooks**

My primary focus is on gradually developing some practical, portfolio-ready projects that reflect existing, real-world analytics problems and reducing user risk.
